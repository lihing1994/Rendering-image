# Introduction
 - The project focus on creating a 3D enivernment and rendering an image based on the enivernment we just defined using Ray-Tracing algorthim. To make the image looks more realistic, the following shading technique and lighting effects have been implemented including, Phong shading, Lambert shading, Point-light, Spot-light, Area-light, and mirror reflection effect. The project is implemented by OpenFrameWork, which is a C++ toolkit. In order to run this project, you may download the OpenFrameWork toolkit by cliking following link:  [Link To Download OpenFrameWork](https://openframeworks.cc/download/)
