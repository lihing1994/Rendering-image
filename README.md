# Introduction
 - The project focus on creating a 3D enivernment and rendering an image based on the enivernment we just defined using Ray-Tracing algorthim. To make the image looks more realistic, the following shading technique and lighting effects have been implemented including, Phong shading, Lambert shading, Point-light, Spot-light, Area-light, and mirror reflection effect. The project is implemented by OpenFrameWork, which is a C++ toolkit. In order to run this project, you may download the OpenFrameWork toolkit by cliking following link:  [Link To Download OpenFrameWork](https://openframeworks.cc/download/)<br /><br />


## Creating an OpenFrameWork Project on your computer(You may skip this steps if you are familiar with OpenFrameWork).
- After you downloaded the OpenFrameWork to your computer, you may unzip the zip file you just downloaded. Then, in the same directory, you may find a folder that containes all the necessarily files for the OpenFrameWork (e.g The name of the folder should appear as the following formate : of_XXXXXXXXX_XXX_release).

# View objects explaination
- Now if you compile and run the project, you will have a Window as the following picture. First, all the small spheres in **yellow** and **black** color are representing the **point light**, which emits light ray in 360 degree. Then, the two small spheres in **yellow** and **white** color with arrows are representing the spot-light. The two panels in **yellow** and **blue** colors with many arrows are representing the area-light. The three big spheres in **blue**,**yellow**,and **red** colors are defined as the **sceneObject**. The rabbit, which is sitting on the **yellow** sphere is a Mesh object. Finally, the wall panels and the table panels are defined as **plane** object, which is inherited from the **SceneObject**.

# Adding renderable scene object into the RayTracingSystem 
-  In **ofApp.cpp** file, you may add **floor plane/wall plane** object to the System. The following code are an examples to add **Plane** object to **RayTracingSystem**. 
```
this->_ray_tracing_system->addSceneObject(new Plane(glm::vec3(0,-2,0),glm::vec3(0,1,0),ofColor::lightCyan,40,40, nullptr,true)); // A mirror reflectable Plane with not texture.
this->_ray_tracing_system->addSceneObject(new Plane(glm::vec3(0,18,-20),glm::vec3(0,0,1),ofColor::skyBlue,40,40, new ofImage("wallPlaneTexter.jpeg"))); //A plane with texture but no mirror reflectable.
this->_ray_tracing_system->addSceneObject(new Plane(glm::vec3(0,18,-20),glm::vec3(0,0,1),ofColor::skyBlue,40,40))); // A plane with no texture and is no mirror reflectbale. 
```
The First parameter : position of the plane.<br />
The second parameter : normal vector of the plane.<br /> 
The thrid parameter(optional) : the color of the plane.<br />
The fourth parameter(optional) : the width of the plane.<br />
The fifth parameter(optional): the length of the plane.<br />
The sixth parameter(optional): the pointer to ofImage object.<br />
The last parameter(optional): a boolean value stands if the plane is mirror reflectable or not.<br />

**Note: if you don't pass value to a optional parameter, the constructor of the **Plane** object will provide default value for it.**

- In **ofApp.cpp** file, you may add **sphere** to System. The following code is an example to add **sphere** object to **RayTracingSystem**.
```
this->_ray_tracing_system->addSceneObject(new Sphere(glm::vec3(-4,2,0),3.0f,ofColor::blue)); // A sphere.
this->_ray_tracing_system->addSceneObject(new Sphere(glm::vec3(-6,2,0),3.0f)); // A sphere with default color.
this->_ray_tracing_system->addSceneObject(new Sphere(glm::vec3(-6,2,0),3.0f,ofColor::white,true)); // A mirror reflectable sphere.
```
The First parameter : position of the sphere.<br />
The second parameter : the raduis of the sphere.<br /> 
The thrid parameter(optional) : the color of the sphere.<br />

- In **ofApp.cpp** file, you may add **MeshObj** object by importing information from an **obj** file, which is a geometry definition file format. To render image perfectly, the **obj** file should only contains information of **Triangle Mesh**. The following link is showing you how to convert **Polygon** faces to **Triangle** Mesh using AutoDesk Maya.<br />
[Convert Polygon faces to Triangle Mesh](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2020/ENU/Maya-Modeling/files/GUID-46439E7A-3FD0-460B-93FC-23917179D101-htm.html)<br /><br />
 The following code is an example to add **MeshObj** object to **RayTracingSystem**.
```
this->_obj_file = new ofxAssimpModelLoader();
if(_obj_file->loadModel("Rabbit_Lowpoly_1.obj"))
{
    this->_ray_tracing_system->addSceneObject(new MeshObj(glm::vec3(0, 6, 2), _obj_file, ofColor::saddleBrown, ofColor::gray));
}
else
{
    std::cout<<"Can't not load the obj file"<<std::endl;
    return;
}
```
The first parameter in the constructor of **MeshObj** object: the position for obj file.<br />
The second parameter in the constructor of **MeshObj** object : the pointer to **ofxAssimpModelLoader**, which is used to load obj file.<br /> 
The thrid parameter in the **MeshObj** object(optional): the diffuse color for each **Triangle Mesh** in the **obj** file.<br />
The fourth parameter in the constructor of **MeshObj** object(optional): the special color for each **Triangle Mesh** in the **obj** file.<br />

# Explantion of addLightSource function in RayTracingSystem. 
- The addLightSource function in the **RayTracingSystem** takes three parameters, a pointer to one type of light, and two boolean vaule. The first parameter is mandatory while second and the thrid are optional.
The first parameters is a pointer to one of lightscoure object as following: 
- LightSource, which is normal point light with 360 illumination angle.
- SpotLight, which is inherited from LightSource, and it has limited illumination angle.
- AreaLight, which is inherited from LightSource, and it is considered as integration of many of point light object in one panel. <br /><br />

The second of boolean parameter:
- It represents if the light being added to the **RayTracingSystem** is a **SpotLight** object or not. It is a optional paramter. If you don't provide a value to this parameter, the default value for this parameter is **false**. <br /><br />

The thrid pf boolean parameter: 
- It represents if the light being added to the **RayTracingSystem** is a **AreaLight** object or not. It is a optional paramter. If you don't provide a value to this parameter, the default value for this parameter is **false**. <br /><br />

# Adding different type of light source to the rendering system. 
- In **ofApp.cpp** file, you may add normal **LightSource** object, which is a **point light**, to rendering system. The following code is an example to add **LightSource** object to **RayTracingSystem**.
```
this->_ray_tracing_system->addLightSource(new LightSource(glm::vec3(-16,23,-17),5.0f,ofColor::yellow));
```
Each parameter in the constructor of **LightSource** object as following:
The first: the position of **LightSource**.<br />
The second: the intensity of the **LightSource**.<br /> 
The thrid: the color of the **LightSource**.<br />
The fourth(optional): the coefficient of Phong power of the **LightSource**.<br />

<br /><br />

- In **ofApp.cpp** file, you may add **SpotLight** object to rendering system. The following code is an example to add **SpotLight** object to **RayTracingSystem**.**A SpotLight is inherited from LightSource.**
```
// Note: The boolean parameter in the function addLightSource function is representing that 
//       if the lightsource being added is a SpotLightSource object or not. 
this->_ray_tracing_system->addLightSource(new SpotLightSource(glm::vec3(8,10,12),5.0f,15.0f,glm::vec3(-4,2,0),ofColor::white),true);
```
Each parameter in the constructor of **SpotLight** object as following:
The First: position of the SpotLight.<br />
The second: the intensity of the **SpotLight**.<br /> 
The thrid: the illumination angle of **SpotLight**.<br />
The fourth: the direction vector that SpotLight is pointing to.<br />
The fifth(optional): the color of the **SpotLight**.<br />

**Note: The last boolean parameter is standing for if the lightsource being added is a SpotLightSource object or not. 
A SpotLight is inherited from LightSource.**

<br /><br />

- In **ofApp.cpp** file, you may add **AreaLight** object to rendering system. The following code is an example to add **AreaLight** object to **RayTracingSystem**.
```
// Note: The second boolean parameter in the addLightSource function is representing 
//       if the lightsouce being added is a spotlight or not. 
//       In this case, you want to add a arealight, therefore it value of that boolean parameter is false.
//       The last boolean parameter in the addLightSource function is representing 
//       if the lightsouce being added is a arealight or not. 
//       In this case, the value of the boolean parameter is true. 
this->_ray_tracing_system->addLightSource(new AreaLight(glm::vec3(-15,5,0),glm::vec3(1,0,0),100.0f,-40.0f,ofColor::yellow,3.0f,3.0f,5),false,true);
```
Each parameter in the constructor of **AreaLight** object as following: <br />
The first : position of the **AreaLight**.<br />
The second : the outer normal of the **AreaLight**.<br /> 
The thrid : the intensity coefficient of **AreaLight**.<br />
The fourth : the rotation angle relative to axis, which is parallel to **AreaLight**.<br /> <br />
(e.g) For instanc, if an **AreaLight** object has a outer normal (1,0,0), the illumination dirction of the **AreaLight** is to the positive x axis.<br />
      Then, rotation angle for this **AreaLight** is relatvie to positvie y axis. <br /><br />
The fifth : the color of the **AreaLight**.<br />
The sixth : the length of the **AreaLight**.<br />
The seventh : the width of the **AreaLight**. <br/>
The last : number of n by n **pointLight** has been integraled in **AreaLight**. <br/>
(e.g) if the value of the last parameter is 5, it means there are number of 5x5, which is 25, pointLight objects has been included in the **AreaLight** <br/><br/>
